# BFI Trading Strategy Implementation

## Overview

This implementation is based on the **BFI (Banks and Financial Institutions) Trading Methodology** from your PDF trading plan. The strategy focuses on identifying and following the footprints of large financial institutions to trade alongside them.

## Core Principles

### 1. BFI Footprint Identification
- **Definition**: A valid BFI footprint is an impulsive market movement that breaks previous market swing points
- **Validation**: Must break at least 1 previous swing point to be considered valid
- **Timeframes**: Primary focus on 4H and 1W timeframes for footprint identification

### 2. Monthly Bias Analysis
- **First Step**: Always determine monthly directional bias before any trading
- **Three States**: Bullish, Bearish, or Potentially Reversing
- **Zone Awareness**: Identify monthly buy/sell zones where reversals are likely

### 3. First Retest Opportunities
- **Strategy**: Wait for price to return to the origin of a valid BFI footprint
- **Entry**: Enter on the first retest of the valid BFI range
- **Confirmation**: Require valid entry signals within the range

## Implementation Components

### 1. BFI Trading Strategy Class (`lib/bfi-trading-strategy.ts`)

#### Key Methods:
- `determineMonthlyBias()` - Analyzes monthly timeframe for directional bias
- `findValidFootprints()` - Identifies valid BFI footprints on specified timeframes
- `findTradingSetups()` - Finds first retest opportunities
- `executeSetup()` - Executes trading setups with proper risk management

#### Core Features:
- **Footprint Validation**: Automatically validates footprints based on swing point breaks
- **Range Drawing**: Calculates proper entry ranges from footprint origins
- **Entry Signal Detection**: Identifies pinbar, engulfing, and Fibonacci retracement signals
- **Risk Management**: Implements 1:3, 1:4, 1:5 risk-reward ratios

### 2. Frontend Components

#### BFI Trading Panel (`components/BFITradingPanel.tsx`)
- **Real-time Setup Display**: Shows available BFI trading setups
- **Active Trade Monitoring**: Tracks currently active positions
- **Monthly Bias Analysis**: Displays current monthly bias and zones
- **Setup Execution**: Allows manual execution of validated setups

### 3. API Endpoints

#### `/api/bfi/monthly-bias`
- Returns monthly directional bias for specified instrument
- Includes buy/sell zones and bias state

#### `/api/bfi/setups`
- Returns available BFI trading setups
- Includes active trades and setup details

#### `/api/bfi/execute`
- Executes BFI trading setups
- Handles position sizing and order placement

## Trading Rules Implementation

### 1. Three Stages of Trade Setup

#### Finding (Pre-Click)
- **Monthly Bias Analysis**: Determine overall market direction
- **Footprint Identification**: Find valid BFI footprints on 4H/1W
- **Range Validation**: Draw proper entry ranges at footprint origins

#### Entering (Click)
- **First Retest**: Wait for price to return to valid BFI range
- **Signal Confirmation**: Require valid entry signals (pinbar, engulfing, Fibonacci)
- **Risk Management**: Set proper stop losses and targets

#### Leaving (Post-Click)
- **Target Achievement**: Let trades reach 1:3, 1:4, 1:5 targets
- **Stop Loss Protection**: Honor stop losses without interference
- **Position Management**: Monitor and adjust as needed

### 2. Entry Signal Types

#### Pinbar Signals
- **Requirements**: Wick multiple times longer than body
- **Location**: Must print within valid BFI range
- **Confirmation**: Multiple pinbars strengthen the setup

#### Engulfing Signals
- **Requirements**: Current candle completely engulfs previous
- **Direction**: Must align with BFI footprint direction
- **Strength**: Engulfing a pinbar increases signal strength

#### Fibonacci Retracement
- **Levels**: 50%, 61.8%, 78.6% retracement levels
- **Validation**: Must align with existing basing zones
- **Timing**: Use 38.2% level to confirm A to B completion

### 3. Risk Management

#### Position Sizing
- **Conservative Approach**: Start with small position sizes
- **Risk Per Trade**: Maximum 1-2% of account per trade
- **Scaling**: Increase position sizes as experience grows

#### Stop Loss Placement
- **Conservative**: Below the valid BFI range
- **Aggressive**: Below the entry signal wick
- **Dynamic**: Adjust based on market conditions

#### Target Setting
- **Primary**: 1:3 risk-reward ratio
- **Secondary**: 1:4 risk-reward ratio
- **Tertiary**: 1:5 risk-reward ratio

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Data Structure

```typescript
interface BFIFootprint {
  id: string;
  instrument: string;
  timeframe: string;
  origin: { low: number; base: number; timestamp: number };
  range: { floor: number; base: number };
  strength: number; // Number of swing points broken
  direction: 'bullish' | 'bearish';
  volume: number;
  isValid: boolean;
}

interface BFISetup {
  id: string;
  instrument: string;
  footprint: BFIFootprint;
  monthlyBias: 'bullish' | 'bearish' | 'potentially_reversing';
  entryRange: { floor: number; base: number; midpoint: number };
  entrySignals: BFISignal[];
  riskRewardRatio: number;
  stopLoss: number;
  targets: number[];
  status: 'waiting' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'invalidated';
}
```

3. **Range Drawing**: Calculate entry ranges at footprint origins
4. **Retest Detection**: Monitor for first retest opportunities
5. **Signal Validation**: Confirm entry signals within ranges
6. **Setup Creation**: Generate trading setups with proper risk/reward
